## **üîÑ Key Contract Interactions**

1. **Campaign Creation Flow**:
   - Factory contract creates new Campaign instance with milestone details
   - Campaign initializes with Active status and first milestone active

2. **Donation Flow**:
   - User sends ETH via `donate()` function
   - Campaign issues tokens based on current token value
   - Tokens determine donor's voting weight

3. **Milestone Completion Flow**:
   - Campaign owner submits proof via `submitMilestoneProof()`
   - Owner requests voting via `requestVoting()`
   - Donors vote with `castVoteOnMilestone()`
   - After voting deadline, `calculateVotingResult()` determines outcome
   - If approved, owner can release funds via `releaseFunds()`

4. **Campaign Conclusion**:
   - Campaign completes when all milestones are completed
   - Campaign fails if deadline passes without completion or any milestone fails
   - Donors can request refunds if campaign fails

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations**

1. **Token Value Adjustment**:
   - Token value decreases after each milestone to incentivize early donors
   - Tokens are non-transferable and only used for voting

2. **Voting System**:
   - Voting weight is proportional to donation amount
   - Milestone approval requires more approve votes than reject+abstain combined

3. **Fund Management**:
   - Funds are released incrementally based on milestone completion
   - Refunds available if campaign fails
